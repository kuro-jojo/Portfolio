# My personal website

This website is a personal project that, first of all is a portfolio and also contains multiple features.

## Functionalities

### List of personal projects (hosted on GIthub)

The portfolio contains my main projects on github.
To do so, I use the Github API to get the repositories that are starred.

As I am using **python** for this project, I use the **PyGithub** module.
